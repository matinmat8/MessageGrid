This is what every project needs.

- You can add this microservice to your project and configure it to send notifications, SMS notifications, email notifications, or any other type of notification.
- This flexible microservice allows you to configure it with your SMS provider or email provider to send notifications.

- It has a comprehensive feature that consumes messages from Kafka, deciding on its own which type of notification to send, including scheduled notifications.
- Strengthened with the factory pattern, you can add any type of notification you want to send.

- Additionally, you can add controllers to send notifications using APIs, as the services are independent and can be used anywhere you want!

- Feel free to integrate this microservice into your project. I would be delighted if you use this microservice and enjoy its flexibility and comprehensive features.
